The number of attacks increased with speedy development in web communication in the last couple
of years. The anomaly detection method for IDS has become substantial in detecting novel attacks in
intrusion detection system (IDS). Achieving high accuracy is the significant challenge in designing
an intrusion detection system. It also emphasizes applying different feature selection techniques to
identify the most suitable feature subset. The author uses extremely randomized trees (extra-tree) for
feature importance. The author tries multiple thresholds on the feature importance parameters to find
the best features. If single classifiers use, then the classifier’s output is wrong, so that the final decision
may be wrong. So, the author uses an extra-tree classifier applied to the best-selected features. The
proposed method is estimated on standard datasets KDD CUP’99, NSL-KDD, and UNSW-NB15.
The experimental results show that the proposed approach performs better than existing methods in
detection rate, false alarm rate, and accuracy.
